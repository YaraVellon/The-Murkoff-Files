                <h2>Who are the Specialists?</h2>
                <p>Specialists are advanced enemy units in the Trials, each with unique abilities and attack patterns designed to challenge Reagents. Unlike Grunts, Specialists are intelligent, unpredictable, and often have special skills that affect both the environment and players directly. Learning how to deal with each type is key to survival.</p>

        <section class="specialist-jaeger">
            <div>
                <h2>Jaeger</h2>
                <p>Jaegers are aggressive trackers that relentlessly pursue Reagents. They have heightened senses and can detect movement and noise from a distance. They prefer ambushes and are highly effective in corridors and enclosed areas.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep moving to avoid detection.</li>
                    <li>Use obstacles and corners to break line of sight.</li>
                    <li>Team coordination helps distract the Jaeger and split its attention.</li>

            <div>
                <h2>Pouncer</h2>
                <p>Pouncers are fast, leaping units that attack from above or from hidden positions. Their sudden jumps can catch Reagents off-guard, making them especially dangerous in open spaces.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch for signs of a Pouncer above or behind cover.</li>
                    <li>Keep your distance and avoid predictable paths.</li>

            <div>
                <h2>Screamer</h2>
                <p>Screamers emit high-pitched sounds that disorient Reagents, causing temporary vision and hearing impairment. They are usually found in groups or near key objectives.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Move cautiously when a Screamer is nearby.</li>
                    <li>Use sound-based distractions to lure them away from objectives.</li>
                    <li>Maintain team coordination to compensate for disorientation effects.</li>

            <div>
                <h2>Pusher</h2>
                <p>Pushers specialize in shoving Reagents into hazards or off ledges. Their attacks are forceful and often catch players off-balance, particularly in narrow spaces.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep a safe distance from edges or traps.</li>
                    <li>Be ready to dodge their sudden shoves.</li>
                    <li>Use environmental cover to avoid direct pushes.</li>

                <h2>Imposters</h2>
                <p>Imposters disguise themselves as Reagents to confuse the team. They can sabotage objectives and attack unsuspecting players. Spotting them early is critical to avoid traps and ambushes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Observe player behavior to identify imposters.</li>
                    <li>Stick with your team to reduce risk of isolation.</li>

                <h2>Night Hunter</h2>
                <p>Night Hunters are stealth-oriented units that excel in low-light environments. They ambush Reagents silently and are extremely difficult to detect until too late.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use light sources strategically to reveal Night Hunters.</li>

                <p>Berserkers are highly aggressive, fast, and deal massive damage in melee. They pursue isolated Reagents relentlessly and can quickly overwhelm unprepared players.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain distance and avoid direct confrontations.</li>
                    <li>Use obstacles and team coordination to slow them down.</li>
                    <li>Distract with Rigs before engaging or escaping.</li>

                <h2>Scapegoat</h2>
                <p>Scapegoats are deceptive units that draw attention away from more dangerous enemies. They create diversions and lure Reagents into traps or ambushes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t chase Scapegoats impulsively.</li>
