                <h2>Who are the Reagents?</h2>
                <p>Reagents are the human test subjects of the Murkoff Corporation's experimental programs, forced into high-risk Trials designed to test psychological endurance and physical capability. They are equipped with experimental tools and rigs, allowing them to interact with the environment, evade or counter Prime Assets, and cooperate with teammates under extreme pressure. Each Reagent has unique skills and abilities that can be enhanced over time.</p>

        <section class="reagents-behavior">
            <div>
                <h2>Behavior in the Trials</h2>
                <p>Reagents are the core participants of the Trials. They must navigate complex environments, complete objectives, and survive against Prime Assets and environmental hazards. Coordination with teammates, careful resource management, and strategic use of Rigs and tools are key to surviving. Reagents often rely on stealth, distractions, and quick thinking to overcome the dangers posed by Murkoff experiments.</p>

                <h2>Abilities & Rigs</h2>
                <p>Reagents can acquire various Rigs and abilities to help them in the Trials. These can be unlocked using in-game currency or progression, and each Rig has multiple upgrade levels. Examples include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Stun Rig:</strong> Emits an electric shock to stun enemies. Upgrades can increase radius, destroy traps, extend stun duration, and reduce cooldown.</li>
                    <li><strong>EMP Rig:</strong> Disables electronic devices and traps in the area. Higher levels can increase effect radius and duration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shield Rig:</strong> Deploys a temporary barrier to block attacks. Upgrades can increase durability and reduce cooldown.</li>
                    <li><strong>Med Rig:</strong> Provides instant healing or stamina recovery to self or nearby players. Higher levels improve healing speed and range.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distraction Rig:</strong> Creates noise or visual effects to confuse enemies. Upgrades extend duration and increase effect area.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Mastering these rigs is essential for survival, especially in higher difficulty Trials where multiple Prime Assets are active and environmental hazards are unpredictable.</p>

                <h2>Tips for Playing as a Reagent</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coordinate with your team: Communication is key to survive ambushes and complete objectives.</li>
                    <li>Manage your resources: Rigs and abilities have cooldowns and limited usage.</li>
                    <li>Observe enemy patterns: Understanding Prime Asset behavior helps avoid deadly encounters.</li>
                    <li>Use the environment: Traps, doors, and obstacles can be leveraged to your advantage.</li>
                    <li>Stay mobile: Standing still makes you an easy target for Prime Assets.</li>
                    <li>Upgrade wisely: Focus on rigs that complement your playstyle and adapt to the challenges of each Trial.</li>
